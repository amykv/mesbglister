Marks the class as a Data Access Object.

Data Access Objects are the main classes where one can define database interactions. They can include a variety of query methods.

The class marked with @Dao should either be an interface or an abstract class. At compile time, Room will generate an implementation of this class when it is referenced by a Database.

     * All queries must be executed on a separate thread. They cannot be executed from Main Thread or it will cause an crash.
     *
     * Room has Kotlin coroutines support.
     * This allows queries to be annotated with the suspend modifier and then called from a coroutine
     * or from another suspension function.

     * When data changes, usually want to take some action, such as displaying the updated data in the UI.
     * This means there has to be a way to observe the data so when it changes, to be able to react.
     *
     * To observe data changes we will use Flow from kotlinx-coroutines.
     * Use a return value of type Flow in method description,
     * and Room generates all necessary code to update the Flow when the database is updated.
     *
     * A Flow is an async sequence of values
     * Flow produces values one at a time (instead of all at once) that can generate values from async operations
     * like network requests, database calls, or other async code.
     * It supports coroutines throughout its API, allows ability to transform a flow using coroutines as well.
