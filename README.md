Create, edit, track, and share custom army lists for Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game.

This app was created so my friends and I can quickly brainstorm and share army lists with each other. App is currently under review for Google Play store release, link will be shared here.

Ideally plan to add more functionality, fixes, and features in future releases.

## Installation:
MESBGLister will be released on Google Play Store.
Currently, fork it or import the zip file into Android Studio. Run it from an emulator or transfer it onto the users device.

## MVVM Architecture:
Model: This layer is responsible for the abstraction of the data sources. Model and ViewModel work together to get and save the data.

View: The purpose of this layer is to inform the ViewModel about the userâ€™s action. This layer observes the ViewModel and does not contain any kind of application logic.

ViewModel: It exposes those data streams which are relevant to the View. Moreover, it serve as a link between the Model and the View.
